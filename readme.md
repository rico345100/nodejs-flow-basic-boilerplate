# Node.js + Flow Basic Boilerplate
Super simple start setup for Node.js and Flow integration.

## What's in here?
- Flow
- Babel

## How to run
Just type 'npm start'.

```bash
$ npm start
```

This will proceed these steps:

1. Run Flow. If there is any problem with your syntax, it will stop immediately.
2. Run the simple script to check directory exists or not. If not, it generates for you. This is really important because Babel doesn't create directory for you.
3. Run Babel to transpile the code.
4. Run the transpiled Node.js code.
